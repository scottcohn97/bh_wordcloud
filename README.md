# Bowles-Halliday Word Clouds

## Scott Cohn

This project takes a folder of PDFs (`\bh_pdfs`), one per chapter, converts the files to a `.txt` files and places the `.txt` file in a new folder (`\bh_txts`). A cleaning function parses the text and finds the most frequent words and n-grams and compiles them into a list of top-X words. This list is ported to an external application, Wordl, to create a word cloud.

This is an extension of the forthcoming microeconomics text found [here](http://simondhalliday.com/microeconomics/).

Here is an example:

<img src="bh_clouds/cloud_01.png"
     alt="ch01"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

The only file that needs to be run is the `bh_wordcloud` file.
